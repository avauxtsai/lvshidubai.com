                        <p>I come from Yunnan, and I’m now in my tenth year of
                            practicing law. Protecting individual
                            freedom
                            against
                            the
                            powerful authority of the state to take freedom away is an important contribution to the
                            overall
                            mission
                            of
                            justice. Confining someone to a cell and restricting his contact with others are serious
                            limits
                            on a
                            person’s rights. There must be a just cause to do this. Lawyers choose to represent criminal
                            clients
                            because
                            we want to make sure that a high standard of law is being applied to these important
                            cases.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/stories_01/01_02.jpg" alt="">
                        </figure>
                        <p>During my second year of practice, I worked on a case
                            where the defendant faced a long list of
                            very
                            serious
                            charges -- murder, drug trafficking, rape, robbery -- each potentially carrying the death
                            penalty.
                            The
                            prosecutors went ahead and charged him with four capital crimes. There was only about one
                            week
                            from
                            the
                            time
                            I took the case until the court appearance. However, as I became familiar with the case, I
                            realized
                            that
                            each of the four charges had serious evidentiary problems. A closer look at the evidence
                            showed
                            that
                            the
                            prosecutors lacked fundamental proof of crime, let alone sufficient proof to warrant the
                            most
                            serious
                            sentence imaginable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/stories_01/01_03.jpg" alt="">
                        </figure>
                        <p>For the drug trafficking charge, there was no physical evidence. There were no drugs seized.
                            The
                            prosecutor
                            had charged my client based solely on the word of another person. There was no evidence of
                            any
                            other
                            kind.
                            To seek the death penalty simply on the word of another person shows how dangerous the death
                            penalty
                            can
                            be.
                            It was excessive. How can a person be convicted of drug trafficking without basic evidence
                            such
                            as
                            drugs,
                            money, or transactions -- let alone be sentenced to death? I stepped in to oppose the death
                            penalty,
                            challenging the strength of the case.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>

                        <p>Rape is an extremely serious crime. However, in this case, the two other co-defendants who
                            had
                            confessed were given sentences of 12 to 15 years. They were spared death, but my client was
                            being charged with the death penalty. There was no physical or DNA evidence linking any of
                            them
                            to the crime, so what accounts for the discrepancy in sentencing? Why was my client being
                            charged with the death penalty? Was it simply as a punishment for not confessing?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/stories_01/01_05.jpg" alt="">
                        </figure>
                        <p>As for the robbery charge, in my opinion, it didn’t warrant a death penalty. It wasn’t
                            technically a robbery, but theft from a dead body. In some cases, robbery can be even more
                            serious than murder. Murder can be a crime of instantaneous passion, but robbery is always
                            premeditated to some degree. However, taking something from a dead body is not the same as
                            threatening a live person with violence in order to steal property.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/stories_01/01_06.jpg" alt="">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Finally, for the murder charge, the accused had surrendered to the police and claimed to have
                            killed someone. The police sent an excavator to search for a body, but never found anything.
                            Without a body, there is no way to know if it is a real case. Was there a murder or not?
                            There
                            was also some cell-phone evidence suggesting that the presumed victim thought to be dead was
                            in
                            fact still alive. Apparently the “victim” had sent messages after the time when he had
                            supposedly died.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">

                        </figure>
                        <p>At the first trial, we got an acquittal on the murder charge. When my client was acquitted, I
                            could see hope in his eyes. We appealed on the remaining charges, and had both the rape and
                            drug
                            trafficking sentences reduced to imprisonment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>But after two appeals, he still faced death-penalty charges for the remaining charge of
                            robbery.
                            We appealed and lost one more time. As far as I know, he was eventually executed. I don’t
                            know
                            if my defense helped him or not, but I hope it gave him the will to live. Because this case
                            happened early in my career, it has special significance for me. This case makes very clear
                            why
                            defendants need lawyers and what role we play. When we defend clients against weak evidence,
                            we
                            are strengthening the entire legal system. I think we can help defendants believe in justice
                            during their darkest time. I’ll keep doing it.

                        <p>I have been in practice for over two decades, and am now a partner in a firm that specializes
                            in
                            criminal
                            defense. I once took up a very famous case. There was a cab driver who went berserk and
                            killed
                            more
                            than
                            twenty people. The events took place in a busy area with crowds of people. He wasn’t a
                            serial
                            killer
                            who
                            murdered many people over a long period of time, this was one killing spree. It was a very
                            sensational
                            case.
                            He was charged with multiple murders and faced the death penalty. I hoped I could
                            participate in
                            this
                            case
                            for some benefit to the public.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <img src="images/stories_02/02_02.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Our argument for the defense was that my client was mentally unstable and therefore cannot be
                            treated
                            as
                            a
                            normal defendant. The law provides for such exceptional cases, but of course it is very
                            difficult to
                            make
                            this argument. It is rare for a court to take insanity into consideration. But as we built
                            our
                            case,
                            we
                            became absolutely convinced that we had an exceptional situation on our hands.
                        </p>

                    <div class="slider-wrap">

                        <p>The goal was to obtain a court-ordered mental evaluation, which would have the highest
                            evidentiary
                            weight,
                            and whose legitimacy would be hard to challenge. I studied a lot of books about mental
                            health,
                            and
                            we
                            tried
                            to match my client’s situation with the conditions we read about. We researched the family’s
                            history
                            with
                            mental illness, any instances of abuse or trauma, and whether the defendant demonstrated
                            unstable
                            behavior
                            before the killings. We found that he had relatives who suffered from mental illness, that
                            there
                            had
                            been
                            cases of incest in the family, and that he himself was not behaving normally before he
                            committed
                            the
                            murders. We documented all of this for the court, submitting proof of family history, recent
                            odd
                            behavior,
                            and so on.

                        <p>Eventually, we succeeded in persuading the court. The weight of all this evidence moved the
                            judge
                            to rule in our favor. My client’s mental health was rapidly deteriorating, and the judge
                            could
                            see that he was not competent to stand trial and needed immediate treatment. The judge
                            ordered a
                            formal evaluation, which concluded that in fact the defendant was genuinely mentally ill. He
                            ended up receiving a fifteen-year sentence.

                        <p>I was proud of my accomplishment in serving my client, and that case had a big impact on my
                            career. Being a criminal defense attorney is like being a doctor. We have technology that
                            can
                            assist the doctor, or the team surrounding the doctor might increase his effectiveness, but
                            the
                            doctor still needs a strong inner drive and ability. Personal ability matters most. A good
                            lawyer is not easily replaced. I helped my client avoid execution by pursuing a rare
                            strategy, a
                            rare treatment, which required extraordinary preparation and some innovation.

                        <p>I once had a case which was remarkable because it was brought to me not by the accused or his

                            but

                            ago

                            the
                            accused was only in his twenties. The facts of the case are as follows: There were two small
                            villages in
                            a
                            remote area. An event was taking place one night where the village youth would gather
                            together
                            to
                            sing
                            and
                            dance. At about 10 pm that evening, two young men met in the road between the two villages.
                            There
                            was an
                            explosion in the road, an explosive device had been placed underground, and one of the two

                            died.

                            difficult
                            case for the police to investigate. The police questioned every young person who might have
                            been
                            involved or
                            present to see if they had information or evidence about what happened. It turned out that
                            the
                            village
                            leader had had an argument with my client six months earlier, which caused the police to
                            turn
                            their
                            attention on him. The police also suspected my client because he did not have an alibi. His
                            little
                            brother
                            had confirmed that my client had gone out after 9pm and had not come back until much later.
                            Also,
                            the
                            police
                            found materials to make an explosive device in his home and believed my client had placed
                            the
                            explosive
                            device with the intent to kill the victim.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">

                        <p>The police arrested him, beat him, and questioned him repeatedly until they finally forced a
                            confession.
                            His
                            brother was also arrested and tortured into accusing my client. The accused said that he put
                            the
                            device
                            underground because he had gotten into an argument with the victim and had wanted to hurt
                            him.
                            In
                            fact,
                            my
                            client didn’t even know the victim and so there was no way that he could have had an
                            argument
                            with
                            him.
                            But
                            as my client confessed, the case was closed. My client initially maintained his false
                            confession,
                            believing
                            that would give him a reduced sentence. Usually, a confession might reduce a life sentence
                            to
                            fifteen or
                            twenty years in jail. But in this case, because the crime involved explosives, the long
                            sentence
                            stood
                            unmitigated, and his false confession proved ultimately worthless.

                        <p>During the court proceedings, the client repeatedly denied his involvement in the crime. He
                            explained that all families in their village had explosive materials in their homes because
                            there are stones everywhere in the village and that is the only way to level the land. He
                            also
                            denied being at the scene of the crime at 10pm – at that time he was back home and asleep.
                            Nonetheless, the court sentenced him to life in prison. Upon seeing that his false testimony
                            had
                            landed his own brother in jail for life, the little brother committed suicide.

                    <div class="slider-wrap">

                        <p>After the sentence has been handed down, there is sometimes a final chance at reducing the
                            sentence by making a confession before entering the penal system, but the accused kept
                            denying
                            his guilt. The appeal process started immediately and dragged on for over a decade and a
                            half.
                            Likewise, to earn any credit for good behavior in prison, the prisoner must always confess
                            and
                            show remorse. However, this client insisted on his innocence. It was an unusual stance for a
                            prisoner to take. He has already been sentenced to life in prison and this is a chance to
                            reduce
                            that sentence to maybe 15 years. The prison also doesn’t really want to look after prisoners
                            for
                            such a long time and into their old age, because life sentences are expensive. So the prison
                            took notice of my client’s unusual insistence on his innocence, and the prison director
                            recommended to me that this case might warrant further action.

                        <p>We took on the case after the two appeals had failed, and we applied for a retrial based on a
                            false conviction. At first, the judges said that they did not find anything suspicious and
                            worthy of a re-trial, but after several more years of appeals, we were granted the re-trial.
                            During the re-trial, we pointed out the lack of logic in the original case. Why would the
                            accused have planted the explosive device there? How could he have been sure that the victim
                            would appear at that precise time? Also, why would he have put an explosive device in the
                            road
                            if they had only had a minor argument? The evidence was all circumstantial and based on an
                            unreliable confession.

                        <p>My client has been in jail for over twenty years. If you have been in jail for twenty years
                            or
                            more, and you confess guilt, you can be released. The prison can help the prisoner’s
                            application
                            for relief, but the prisoner must first confess. Yet my client, who has been locked up for
                            over
                            twenty years and who could seek release tomorrow by confessing, still refuses to do so. This
                            is
                            why I want to help him. It has been seven years since I took on this case, and I just keep
                            submitting materials to the court. I truly believe my client is innocent.

                        <p>I’m a member of an ethnic minority. Criminal defense was never my grand mission. I actually
                            wanted to become a police officer or civil servant. But I took the exam and got into the law
                            faculty. I was only 19 at the time, but I qualified with special consideration for my
                            language ability.
                        </p>

                        <p>As I know how to speak a minority language, naturally I was exposed to many situations in
                            which ethnic minorities encountered the legal system. I took a job working at a center for
                            minors, including orphans and other wards of the state. Many couldn’t speak Chinese well,
                            which became a huge obstacle for them in the justice system. They were the weakest in
                            society -- young, unsupported and dependent on the state, and they can’t even really
                            communicate.
                        </p>

                        <p>Unsurprisingly, my first case was not a major case, but it was meaningful to me. I helped my
                            first client who was just sixteen years old. It was a minor robbery case. He didn’t know how
                            to speak Chinese, which was one problem. And he came from a large family with a lot of
                            siblings. As we were providing free legal services, I spoke with his parents, but they told
                            me not to get involved – they told me to let their son learn the hard way through the
                            judiciary system. Whatever the court decides he deserves is what he should get. Let him do
                            his time.

                        <p>But in my opinion, sending a minor to prison is a very complicated thing. It’s not
                            necessarily good for the society or the individual. So, although parents are important, if
                            they are narrow-minded, their children should not be left alone to face a complicated legal
                            system that they don’t understand, and especially if they don’t even speak the language. We
                            should step in to provide proper solutions, including education.

                        <p>Ultimately, this was a very minor and simple case and I share the story only because it shows
                            what it is like for someone from an ethnic minority and from an underprivileged family to
                            face the legal system. These are the kinds of clients that I meet.

                <h1>Lost In Translation</h1>
                <div class="slider">

                        <img src="images/stories_05/05_01.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Several years ago, I represented an ethnic minority client in a robbery case. My client’s
                            Chinese language ability was very limited – he could understand a little, just a few words
                            here and there, but not reliable for more complex communication or official purpose – so I
                            requested official interpretation provided by the court. I explained to the judge that this
                            minority language had many dialects, so it would be important to have the right one. But the
                            judge ruled against me, stating that my client could understand well enough and is simply
                            delaying the proceedings.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <img src="images/stories_05/05_02.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>However, when I reviewed my client’s videotaped interrogations, I saw an obvious pattern of
                            miscommunication. In this man’s dialect, it is normal in conversation for the listener to
                            say, “mmm-hmm,” not as a deliberately affirmative reply to a question, but as a way to say
                            “I’m listening,” a way of demonstrating that I am following and paying attention. This is
                            how he spoke with me as well. But in Chinese, it is easy to interpret these sounds as an
                            answer “yes,” especially in an interrogation with very sharp questioning. Even in court,
                            after each lengthy question from the prosecution, the judge asked the client if he
                            understood, and the judge himself misinterpreted the “mm-hmm”.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <img src="images/stories_05/05_03.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>There were four co-defendants. My client was the only man among the four who persisted in
                            claiming his innocence, despite torture. He said the investigators used computer cables to
                            bind his wrists, then hung him from the ceiling. He told me they used a plastic cigarette
                            lighter, not to burn him, but as a hard object to press between the ribs causing great pain
                            but minimal bruising. When my client maintained his innocence, they made him the primary
                            accused. We also found that there was a central piece of evidence, a closed-circuit video
                            recording, which the police never reviewed. Why use torture and ignore such a central piece
                            of evidence?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slider-wrap">
                        <img src="images/stories_05/05_04.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Luckily, we discovered a document at the detention center where he was being held, a physical
                            examination form that the director had ordered when my client was first transferred there
                            from the police station where he was interrogated. There were obvious signs of injury on my
                            client upon his arrival, and so the doctors examined him and filed a report. At the time, my
                            client told the doctors that he had been mistreated while in custody. The director of the
                            detention center was doing his job correctly. He didn’t want to be accused of allowing
                            mistreatment in his own jailhouse, so he made sure to document any signs of injury upon
                            receiving the prisoner.
                        </p>

                        <p>The result was quite good. We applied to strike down the confession based on torture. You can
                            file before or during a trial, and we filed before the case even began in court. The police
                            responded by discrediting the detention center’s physical exam. However, under law, that
                            report from the detention center can be considered evidence because it is a signed, valid
                            document. The judge ordered the police in charge of the investigation to appear, but only
                            one came. It seemed that the other didn’t dare to show up to explain my client’s injuries.
                            So we got all the coerced confessions thrown out. Although my client didn’t beat the charge
                            in the end, we got a reduced sentence.

                        <p>Cases need both effective representation and good translation for minorities. The two need to
                            go hand in hand. Frankly, there is some bias in my area against ethnic minorities. I advise
                            my ethnic minority clients to always find out exactly the charges against them. Doing these
                            kinds of cases is difficult for me, but what motivates me to keep going is that I want to do
                            something meaningful, and I enjoy the work.
